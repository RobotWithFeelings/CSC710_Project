\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Define what Nass' study was.
    \item Define what is novel about our study in comparison to Nass' original study.
    \item Introduce who our subjects are and the basics of what our methodology was.
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}

\begin{comment}
In research interviews open, frank speech is essential to the process. Interviews are plagued by biases inherent in social interactions. Such biases include the normative-response bias (people not wanting to admit to answers that are counter to the perceived norm), interviewer-based bias (people answering based on the perceived preference of the interviewer), and politeness norms (people modifying answers to avoid offending). Computer systems were introduced to mitigate these known social-biases by providing anonymity. However, through a series of studies, Nass et al. documented how individuals anthropomorphize technology and exhibit attitudes previously thought to be reserved for person to person interaction \cite{nass1999people}\cite{reeves1996people}. Contrary to what was believed at the time, the results suggested that humans unintentionally, unknowingly apply social rules to computer systems.   
This foundational work sparked further studies to replicate, validate, and extend this assertion. Since the initial set of studies were conducted entirely in the United States, additional research validated the findings across other cultures \cite{katagiri2001cross}. Furthermore, the existence of computers as social entities has been studied to better understand racial biases in interviews\cite{krysan2003race}, how the quality of interaction affects expressive systems \cite{vidyarthi2011sympathetic}, and even how to leverage social cues to more effectively sell products online \cite{wang2007can}. To our knowledge, no studies currently exist which attempt to replicate these effects with software developers.   
In order to create better software, it is important to study the attitudes of software developers and how they view their work environments. Given software developersâ€™ advanced understanding of how computers work, one would expect the attribution of social qualities to computers to be minimal or not present. At the same time, it has been shown that humans with accurate mental models are more effective in maintaining teammate bonds with automated computer systems \cite{wilkison2008effects}. Given this premise, we are interested in exploring the following questions:   

\begin{itemize}
    \item Do software developers exhibit social-biases towards computers?
    \item Does ownership1 of the computer modify the exhibited social-biases? 
\end{itemize}
\end{comment}

Previous research demonstrates that computers are often treated as social entities despite their inanimate nature. There have been studies that focus on the human application of social norms and expectations to computers in a seamless manner. Nass et al. performed a series of experiments that pointed out that social stereotypes attributed to gender, ethnicity, and group loyalty, along with deeply ingrained social habits and behaviors like, reciprocity and reciprocal self-disclosure, are extended to computers when interacting with them~\cite{Nass2000machines,nass1999people}. Moreover, prior studies documented that this behavior is not only limited to computers, human users anthropomorphize other technological mediums like television~\cite{reeves1996people}.

\hfill

These findings engendered a number of studies that extended on this implication by replicating, validating, and exploring the possible factors behind these kind of responses. The existing Computers as Social Actors (CASA) studies featured an implicit bias - although the studies were conducted with participants exclusively from the United States, the findings were generalized to all cultures. Katagiri and colleagues performed a comprehensive study to determine whether social rules derived from different cultures affect human users responses to computers by observing participants from the United States and Japan~\cite{katagiri2001cross}. Furthermore, researchers studied the existence of computers as social entities to better understand racial biases in interviews\cite{krysan2003race}, how the quality of interaction affects expressive systems \cite{vidyarthi2011sympathetic}, and even how to leverage social cues to more effectively sell products online \cite{wang2007can}.

\hfill

Software developers maintain a collaborative environment with their development machines to achieve their goals. Given software developers' advanced understanding of how computers work, one would expect the attribution of social qualities to computers to be minimal or not present.  This type of attribution would be expected, if the the sociability of a computer system is modified by the quality of an individual's mental model of a computer system. Research has shown that human-computer team performance is higher when human users have accurate mental models~\cite{wilkison2008effects}. Further studies by Bickmore and Picard have documented the long-term relation establishment and maintenance between a human-computer team by observing that human users of a relational computer agent did not only respect, trust, and like the agent, but also wanted to continue working with the agent even after the end of the study~\cite{Bickmore:2005:EML:1067860.1067867}. 

\hfill

In this paper, we investigate whether a long term relationship between a software developer and her computer has any significant effect on the social norm of politeness witnessed by Nass et al in their original study~\cite{nass1999people} by contrasting their responses to computers with that of non-software developers.

Our work explores the effect of viewing computers as a human-like social entity on the very specific demographic of software developers and attempts to determine the level of politeness software developers exhibit toward their machines.
