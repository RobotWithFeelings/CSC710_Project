  __Summary__: Social stereotypes extending to responses to and interaction with computers:
      1. _Gender_: Evaluation from male-voice is more appreciated and considered more friendly than a female-voice evaluator, despite their contents being identical. Praisal from the male-voice computer was more compelling than the female-voiced one. Female computer considered more informative about love and relationships compared to male-voiced tutor which was considered more informative about computers.
      2. _Ethnicity_: Participants in the same ethnicity of that of the computer emulated perceived the computer agent to be more attractive, trustworthy, persuasive, and intelligent - making decision more similar to them, compared to different ethnicity agent participant condition.
      3. _Group loyalty_: People cooperate and conform to the computer’s suggestion, assess the computer as more friendly and more intelligent, perceives the computer as being similar to themselves, compared to participants in the non-team condition despite completely understanding that the computer is not able to return the participant’s loyalty.
      4. _Deeply ingrained habits and behaviors (overlearning)_: politeness, reciprocity, reciprocal self-disclosure are also mindlessly extended towards computers.
    
    __Linkage to our paper__:
    There have been studies that focus on the human application of social norms and expectations to computers in a seamless manner. Nass and Moon performed a series of experiments that pointed out that social stereotypes attributed to gender, ethnicity, and group loyalty, along with deeply ingrained social habits and behaviors like, reciprocity and reciprocal self-disclosure, are extended to computers when interacting with them.

  __Summary__: Created relational computer agent for long term relation creation and maintenance with their users. Participants who interacted on a daily basis with the relational agent respected, trusted, and liked the relational agent more compared to a non-relational task based agent.
  
  __Linkage to our paper__: With the prevalence of computers throughout society, researchers have also been exploring the factors of creating and maintaining long-term relations between computer and their users. Bickmore and Picard, though their study, found out that human users of a relational computer agent did not only respect, trust, and like the agent, but also wanted to continue working with the agent even after the end of the study. In this work, we investigate whether such long term relationship between a human user and her computer has any significant effect on the social norm of politeness witnessed by Nass et al in their original study.
